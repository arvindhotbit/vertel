<p><strong><em>Who Needs a
mobile phone anymore?</em></strong></p>



<p>Despite mobile phones making their mark in the business world, they are still not sufficient to win every challenge. Not only are they fragile, but they are also time consuming to use as it involves a multi-step process such as picking up and unlocking your phone, opening contacts, dialing up a number, waiting for an answer, etc. That is over and above the monthly charges that come with mobile phone usage.</p>

<p><strong>3. Schools:</strong> Interestingly, several schools in India have adopted two-way radios as their communication technology of choice. In fact, walkie talkies have become a part of the day-to-day operations of several schools across the globe. For instance, crossing guards deployed use these tiny instruments to direct traffic. Moreover, administrators use them to stay in touch with the maintenance workers, janitors. Some of the teachers also use them in fields and playgrounds to make the events safe for the young minds.</p>



<p>Not only that, with schools admitting more and more training staff to deal with worst-case scenarios, <strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/blog/how-do-the-best-handheld-walkie-talkies-work/">short range walkie talkies</a></strong> have become a critical component of school safety programs.</p>



<p><strong>4. Security Professionals:</strong> Security Professionals from the past many years have relied on walkie talkies to perform their duties, which may involve general monitoring to apprehending suspects. Whatever contingency may arise such as accident, theft, walkie talkies allow guards to efficiently alert their operation heads, managers, and also the owners.</p>

Hospitality and Event workers:</strong> Both the entertainment industry and the hospitality sector use walkie talkies on a regular basis to coordinate all the hidden resources that make the first-rate service possible.

<p>Travelling is one of the most significant parts of our
lives cause who doesn’t just love to travel and experience new and beautiful
avenues of living life. Amidst our changing surroundings and global scenario –
the Coronavirus pandemic, higher levels of pollutions, and more, what does a
traveller do? Apart from travelling to the most visited places globally, people
are moving towards unconventional forms of travelling such as trekking, sometimes
with a group and sometimes just solo or with friends or family.</p>



<p>So, what should you carry with yourself when you are
going on a trek?</p>



<ul><li>One of the most essential tools/equipment is to have a high-grade <strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/">wireless walkie talkie</a></strong> with them to communicate in need of an emergency. Smartphones lose battery more quickly than it can be anticipated, so, it is best if you are carrying a <strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/about.php">long-range walkie talkie</a></strong> with you. Also, at a higher altitude, cellular connections are poor, and so, walkie talkies are the best possible option to connect when required.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/analog-vl747.php">Best handheld walkie talkie</a></strong> batteries – fully charged with extra pair. <strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/">Vertel Walkie Talkie</a></strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/"> </a>can last up to 18 hours when used in full capacity, and so if you are on a trek, you must have back-up batteries cause sometimes it takes more than expected time for the trek to finish. It is better to be safe and well-packed than later worried about it.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Walkie talkie pouch to carry your <strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/blog/">best quality walkie talkie</a></strong>. Wearing a pouch will keep you sorted as to where your stuff goes and not confuse you when you need something immediately. Carrying a walkie talkie is a great idea, and carrying it with style and organization is commendable.</li></ul>



<p>You need a walkie talkie for several reasons, but
during a trek, the only reason that counts is – ‘EMERGENCY’. You, I, He, She,
or anyone can get stuck at any point in time, and being connected with someone
/ or your fellow trekkers is the biggest support you can have. The times can be
grave or very jolly on a trek, so just prepare accordingly.</p>



<p>So,&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/blog/guide-on-choosing-the-best-walkie-talkie-for-you/">where to buy walkie talkies</a>&nbsp;</strong>from?</p>



<p>Well,&nbsp;<strong>Vertel walkie talkie</strong>&nbsp;has made both professional and<a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/blog/guide-on-choosing-the-best-walkie-talkie-for-you/">&nbsp;</a><strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/blog/guide-on-choosing-the-best-walkie-talkie-for-you/">industrial walkie talkie</a></strong>&nbsp;available to customers in India.

<p>We live in a dynamic world where interaction and communication are the most integral part of our daily lives. Be it businesses or personal relations, people need to (and like to) interact quite often to keep sane and use the support they can get to get the job done. <strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/">Wireless walkie talkies</a></strong> have helped through the years to establish a quick, safe and hassle-free connection, and it continues to do so.</p>



<p>Time and again, <strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/blog/advantages-of-using-unlicensed-walkie-talkies/">license free walkie talkies</a></strong> by Vertel Digital have made its mark in the industry for its high-quality body and machinery, and the ability to offer seamless communication over a distance. The<a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/blog/guide-on-choosing-the-best-walkie-talkie-for-you/"> </a><strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/blog/guide-on-choosing-the-best-walkie-talkie-for-you/">long range walkie talkies</a></strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/blog/guide-on-choosing-the-best-walkie-talkie-for-you/"> </a>have proven their mettle over today’s smartphone technology that is highly dependent on signals. In contrast, the walkie talkies stand a class apart and help establish connection beautifully without any breaks, disturbances or more.</p>



<p>So, do you feel you are stuck with a poor communication system – such as your smartphone? And, that you need to connect instantly to not affect what you’re doing? Then it is time that you move to Vertel Digital’s<a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/"> </a><strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/">Industrial Walkie Talkie</a></strong>. Why?</p>



<p><em><strong>Firstly,</strong></em>&nbsp;cause why not! Vertel Digital has been
offering Walkie Talkies for almost a decade now and has a vast customer base
across industries. The brand provides high-grade long-range / short range
walkie talkies that can be bought as per the need of the customer, backed with
supportive 24*7 customer service.</p>



<p><em><strong>Secondly</strong></em>, available at a genuine, competitive rate! Vertel
Digital offers nothing but&nbsp;<strong>the best quality walkie talkies</strong>&nbsp;that are
available in the market or at its&nbsp;<strong>e-commerce store</strong>&nbsp;at the decent price range.
All the walkie talkies bought from Vertel are Govt. approved and certified
products with a long life.</p>



<p><em><strong>Thirdly</strong></em>, no recurring cost for hassle-free connection! Unlike smartphones have a recurring cost of display, battery, calling bill and more, <strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/">best radio walkie talkies</a></strong> do not have such recurring costs, because they are built on radio frequency – which is cost-effective, disturbance-free and charges nothing at all.</p>



<p><strong>Vertel Walkie Talkie</strong>&nbsp;has been in business for quite a long time and
have been servicing clients that have very unique, distinct, out-of-the-world
requirements, and have been successful.</p>

that support the argument-</p>

of your ailing old parents, a Vertel walkie talky becomes such a useful tool.
All you need to do is, help them understand what buttons to press, and they can
very easily reach out when in need of something.</em>”</p>

<p>Walkie Talkie comes with a variety of benefits over a smartphone, and it is best to use the <strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/blog/how-do-the-best-handheld-walkie-talkies-work/">best handheld walkie talkie</a></strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/blog/how-do-the-best-handheld-walkie-talkies-work/"> </a>to stay connected hassle-free.</p>



<p>Here is a list of advantages that we have jotted down as to why you should get a walkie talkie for your business/leisure:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Long-lasting Battery:</strong> Phones start dying within a few hours of use, whereas walkie talkies last longer. Vertel Walkie Talkies are good to use for up to 18 hours without any battery charging. But, if you make a call from your phone, it’ll probably just go for 5-6 hours.</li><li> <strong>Stable Connection:</strong> If there is no network, you have no way to communicate with someone using a smartphone. On the other hand, walkie talkies are far away from such problems. You have a stable, on-the-press-of-the-button, and very convenient connection. No network problem. No area problem. Nada!</li><li><strong>No-recurring cost:</strong> While smartphones have a recurring cost of either bill, or broken parts, or breaking screens, walkie talkies have a minimum recurring cost of changing batteries – which you can further lower down by buying rechargeable batteries.</li></ul>
