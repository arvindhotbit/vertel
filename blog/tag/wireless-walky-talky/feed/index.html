<p>If you have never <a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/">bought a walkie talkie</a>, chances are you are rather confused as to which one to go for. It is understandable because they are rather simple looking devices which complex in-built technologies and trying to decipher which one will best suit you can be difficult. A good walkie talkie that allows were efficient communication can be judged by whether it is a UHF (Ultra High Frequency) radio or not. A radio set with UHF has the ability to penetrate areas of high interference. They even allow for communication from within a building to outside the building, for these frequencies can penetrate steel, concrete, and wood. Moreover, look for a high range radio that can ensure long-distance communication as well.</p>



<p>To help make a decision here’s a peek into some features of Vertel’s <strong>wireless walkie talkie,</strong> “Walky Talky &#8211; LF.”</p>

With an ergonomic design, it manages to stay connected at all times and offers UHF, which penetrates the toughest of surfaces. Being a best range walkie talkie, the radio offers a long range, crisp and clear audio and long-lasting battery life. The presence of multiple CTCSS/DCS (Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System/Digitally Coded Squelch) helps remove any disturbance that may come in the form of other voices that may be sharing on the same radio.</p>



<h2>Features</h2>

<ul><li>It offers a frequency band of 446 &#8211; 446.2 Mhz making it a UHF device so even if your requirement is that of radio that can get across channels then this does the job for you.</li><li>This is one of the <strong>long range walkie talkies</strong> that offers a busy channel lockout (BCLO), effectively preventing any interference in an on-going conversation.</li><li>The presence of a Time Out Timer (TOT), minimizes the risk involved in a long transmission. The radio automatically stops transmitting after the pre-set time.</li><li>This device also offers the service of wire cloning, you do not have to spend time setting parameters on a new device, you can just simply pick up another device and clone the parameter set up.</li><li>The industrial walkie talkie also alerts you when the battery is low.</li><li>The clear channel annunciation can help you operate easily even when working in the dark.
