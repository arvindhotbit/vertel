<p>The facility management market has been witnessing a huge boom in India. With ever increasing count of malls, offices, hospitals and other such large-scale facilities , it’s only fair to say that they require effective facility management services to manage housekeeping, maintenance and security setup . Thus, a whole lot of facility management firms have come up. This also means a whole lot of competition in the industry. The only sustainable advantage one facility management firm have over other is how efficiently they manage costs and yet ensure great delivery. The most obvious answer to this efficiency is good communication and to ensure this good communication is where <strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/about.php">long range walkie talkies </a></strong>come in handy. They can actually prove to be rather valuable assets. </p>



<p><strong>What is facility
management?</strong></p>



<p>Facility management encompasses multiple disciplines to ensure functionality, comfort, efficiency and safety in the built environment. An environment that might require a large workforce to maintain and manage the property; such as hospitals, corporate parks, residential apartments, malls and more and here is a list of areas where a <strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/blog/vertels-wireless-walkie-talkie-that-make-communication-easier/">wireless walkie talkie</a> </strong>makes for a valuable asset in a facility management operations.</p>



<p><strong>Parking</strong></p>



<p>In a large facility it becomes essential to provide parking to all the people that come to the facility. Maintaining a parking space is thus, imperative and requires a great amount of communication. Gap in lack of communication has the potential to lead to inefficiency. To avoid this, one can use Vertel’s <strong><a href="https://www.verteldigital.com/">professional walkie talkie</a></strong> and the people managing different checkpoints can thus communicate quickly and efficiently. One cannot keep people waiting to park their vehicles. If at all the parking is full that too can be communicated to the personnel on the main entrance to avoid wasting people’s time. It can lead to almost 15% improvement in time that is wasted in coordinating over mobile phones that have patchy networks in basement or in person</p>



<p><strong>Cleaning &amp;
Maintenance</strong></p>



<p>A good facility is one that is clean. Of course, when so many
people are roaming across the place, dirt is a predictable outcome. It is very
important that any spills or dirty spots be cleaned quickly. There can also be
a situation where there might be an electricity cut, a non-working lift or any
such faults. It’s in situations like these that the <strong>best range walkie talkies </strong>come to the rescue. All someone needs to
do is reach out to the maintenance team and avert a crisis situation.</p>



<p><strong>Security Communication</strong></p>



<p>The most important things for a facility management firm to
ensure is that the security personnel have good communication between them. If
ever there is a breach, theft or any such grave instance, every section in the
facility should be equipped with <strong>commercial
walkie talkies</strong>, so as to reach out to the security. This ensures quick
management of a serious issue. </p>



<p><strong>Emergency Situations</strong></p>



<p>Say, the facility your firm manages is a hospital. A lot of
unpredictable things can happen in a hospital. Any emergency can rise with
patients. In such life-threatening situations, patients need immediate care. A
nurse or relative wouldn’t have the time to hunt for the doctor. Thus, a floor
manager or guard can simply reach out to the front desk with the help of a
walkie talkie and the doctor in charge can quickly tend to the patient. </p>



<p>With so many benefits of using <strong>long range walkie talkies</strong> we’re sure, you understand how important
it is for a facility management firm. Vertel’s efficient walkie talkies come
equipped with a long battery backup, clear voice and a lot more. These compact
yet sturdy equipments offer UHF and VHF along with CTCSS and DCS.</p>
